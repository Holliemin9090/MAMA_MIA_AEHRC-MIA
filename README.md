# MAMA-MIA Challenge 2025: MICCAI Participation

This repository contains our code and documentation for the **MAMA-MIA Challenge 2025**, held as part of the MICCAI conference.

## üß† Challenge Overview

- **Organized by:** Universitat de Barcelona  
- **Official Website:** [https://www.ub.edu/mama-mia/](https://www.ub.edu/mama-mia/)  
- **Tasks:**  
  1. Primary tumor segmentation in DCE-MRI  
  2. Prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy  
- **Data:**  
  - **Training set:** 1506 cases from a large-scale multicenter breast cancer DCE-MRI benchmark dataset  
  - **Test set:** 574 cases from three European centers  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - **Segmentation:** Dice coefficient, normalized Hausdorff Distance, and fairness score  
  - **Classification:** Balanced accuracy and fairness score

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Approach

### ü©ª Task 1: Primary Tumor Segmentation with MedNeXt

We employed the MedNeXt architecture to perform primary tumor segmentation on DCE-MRI scans.

#### üìÅ Data Preparation
- `Data_preparation/Segmentation/Data_preparation_1_channel_as_organizer_baseline.py`  
  Preprocesses post-contrast and subtraction images for segmentation model training.

#### üìÑ Dataset JSON Generation
- `Data_preparation/Segmentation/generate_json_1_channel.py`  
  Generates dataset description JSON following nnU-Netv1 / MedNeXt conventions.

#### üîÄ Cross-Validation Split Generation
- `Data_preparation/Segmentation/generate_split_json_1_channel.py`  
  Generates a 5-fold cross-validation split file (`splits_final.pkl`) for training and validation.

#### üß† Model Training
1. Train model using Dice + Cross-Entropy loss:  
   `train_mednext/run_train_Task012_MedNeXt_L_DC_CE_loss.sh`

2. Fine-tune model using Dice + Top-k Cross-Entropy loss:  
   `train_mednext/run_train_Task012_MedNeXt_L_DC_topk_loss.sh`

3. Ensemble selection and postprocessing:  
   `train_mednext/Determine_ensemble_MedNeXt_L_DC_topk_loss.sh`

### üî¨ Task 2: pCR Prediction

A Random Forest classifier was trained using radiomic and kinetic features extracted from the tumor regions.

#### üß± Feature Extraction
1. ROI extraction for radiomics:  
   `Data_preparation/pcr_classification/Extract_ROI_for_radiomics.py`

2. Radiomic (PyRadiomics) and kinetic feature extraction:  
   `pcr_classification_wt_radiomics/Extract_radiomics.py`

#### ü§ñ Classification
- Train a Random Forest classifier:  
  `pcr_classification_wt_radiomics/pcr_classification_radiomics.py`

## üìä Results

> Final scores and rankings will be updated after the official leaderboard is released.
