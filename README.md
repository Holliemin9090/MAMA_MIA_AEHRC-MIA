# MAMA-MIA Challenge 2025: MICCAI Participation

This repository contains our code and documentation for the **MAMA-MIA Challenge 2025**, held as part of the MICCAI conference.

## üß† Challenge Overview

- **Organized by:** Universitat de Barcelona  
- **Official Website:** [https://www.ub.edu/mama-mia/](https://www.ub.edu/mama-mia/)  
- **Tasks:**  
  1. Primary tumor segmentation in DCE-MRI  
  2. Prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy  
- **Data:** Training data: A large-scale multicenter breast cancer DCE-MRI benchmark dataset with 1506 cases; Validation data:574 cases from three European centres.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Dice, normalized Hausdorff Distance and fairness score (segmentation), balanced accuracy and fairness score (classification).

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Approach

### ü©ª Task 1: Primary Tumor Segmentation with MedNeXt

We used the MedNeXt architecture to segment primary breast tumors from DCE-MRI scans.

#### üìÅ Data Preparation for Training
- `Data_preparation/Segmentation/Data_preparation_1_channel_as_organizer_baseline.py`  
  Preprocesses post-contrast and subtraction images for segmentation training.

#### üìÑ Dataset JSON Generation
- `Data_preparation/Segmentation/generate_json_1_channel.py`  
  Creates the required dataset description JSON file following nnU-Netv1/MedNeXt conventions.

#### üîÄ Cross-Validation Split Generation
- `Data_preparation/Segmentation/generate_split_json_1_channel.py`  
  Generates a 5-fold cross-validation split file (`splits_final.pkl`) for training and validation.

#### Model training
1. Train model with DC+CE loss 
- `train_mednext/run_train_Task012_MedNeXt_L_DC_CE_loss.sh`
2. Fine tune model with DC+topk CE loss
- `train_mednext/run_train_Task012_MedNeXt_L_DC_topk_loss.sh`
3. Determine ensemble and postprocessing
- `train_mednext/Determine_ensemble_MedNeXt_L_DC_topk_loss.sh`

### ü©ª Task 2: PCR prediction
1. Prepare data for radiomic feature extraction
- `Data_preparation/pcr_classification/Extract_ROI_for_radiomics.py`
2. Extract radiomic features (using PyRadiomics) and kinetic features
- `pcr_classification_wt_radiomics/Extract_radiomics.py`
3. Train a Random Forest classifier for pCR classification
- `pcr_classification_wt_radiomics/pcr_classification_radiomics.py`


### Submission inference
The inference scripts for running the trained networks are in `sample_code_submission`


## üìä Results

> Final scores and ranks will be updated after the official leaderboard is released.
